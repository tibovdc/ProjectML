I'm Barbara, a 40 year old local Ghentian crazy about chocolate and pilates! Friends describe me as 'Audrey Hepburn meets bubblegum'! I kinda think this explains it all! ;) 

I host a beautiful house called Sint-Ivo in the historical city center of Ghent. 

The house dates from the 14th century. It was originally called 'The Cogghe' - a referral to the ships that cruised the river. In 1748 the lawyers association together with doorkeepers and prosecutors settled into the house and named it Saint Ivo - lawyer of the poor in the 13th century.

I’m spending a great deal of my time on my passion for coffee and hospitality. Doing sports, traveling, reading and riding my motorbike are some other things I love. 
At this point I have expanded the business to the point that we follow up on the entire chain from coffee tree to cup. I’m spending a lot of time in Colombia, where I visit local farmers in order to get the best coffee for the coffee bar. 
I used to travel quite adventurously myself. I still cherish these memorable moments of spontaneous hospitality and I take this as starting point to treat my guests.

Na een academische carrière en jaren in het onderwijs, ben ik sinds 2011 de trotse eigenaar van het koffiehuis “Café Labath” te Gent. 
Mijn passie voor koffie en hospitality vraagt het grootste deel van mijn tijd, daarnaast ga ik graag sporten, lezen en motorijden. Ik heb enkele avontuurlijke reizen gedaan, en de reismicrobe heeft me nog steeds niet losgelaten. Intussen spendeer ik veel tijd in Colombia, om daar “Direct Trade” koffie te zoeken. Door goede banden op te bouwen met lokale boeren, kan ik de lekkerste koffies importeren voor de koffiebar.
De memorabele momenten van spontane gastvrijheid op mijn reizen koester ik nog steeds. Die gastvrijheid heb ik steeds zelf voor ogen bij het ontvangen van mijn gasten.

Came back to Ghent 6 years ago to open a contemporary art gallery on the ground floor of an old house in the historic centre of Ghent.

I see myself as someone with a natural joy of life. I love to meet new people that share the same enthusiasm.

Although I love travelling, I didn't have much opportunity since I opened the gallery. I can enjoy a weekend city trip as much as a month backpacking on the other side of the world.

Born and raised in Moorslede and Bruges, we studied in Ghent and in Brussels. We fell in love and decided to settle in the beautiful city of Ghent. Whilst looking for a place to live, we bumped into what could be considered as one of the most centralised houses of Ghent. The house was old, dark and didn’t catch a lot of sunlight, but we saw a lot of possibilities to transform it into a little paradise in the ancient centre, close to all the hip and trendy places this city has to offer. As we travel a lot ourselves, we think we know what it takes to have a pleasant stay and discovering new cities and countries. We transformed the house in an ideal place for friends and guests visiting Ghent. By the summer of 2020 the house was finished.   
We hope you enjoy it as much as we do. 
Welcome in Ghent!

I'm Veerle from Ghent.  During college I spent a year in Costa Rica as part of a student exchange program.   I stayed in the house of a lovely family.  They were wonderfully hospitable and after a while I even called them my mammi, pappi & hermanas :-).  I really felt at home there.  I quickly realized how amazing it is to be able to have a home away from home.  Since then, when I travel I always look for a place to stay that gives me that same feeling.  And when my friends, family or you :-)  come to visit beautiful Ghent I try to offer that same kind of hospitality.

Wij zijn Annik & Kristof. 
Wij verwelkomen jullie graag in hartje Gent. 

Kristof kwam ooit in Gent studeren en was meteen verliefd op de stad.  Een heel aantal jaren later werd Annik verliefd op Kristof en kwam zo ook in Gent terecht.

It has enough medieval frivolity to create a spectacle but retains a gritty industrial edge that keeps things ‘real’.

I’m spending a great deal of my time on my passion for coffee and hospitality. Doing sports, traveling, reading and riding my motorbike are some other things I love. 
At this point I have expanded the business to the point that we follow up on the entire chain from coffee tree to cup. I’m spending a lot of time in Colombia, where I visit local farmers in order to get the best coffee for the coffee bar. 
I used to travel quite adventurously myself. I still cherish these memorable moments of spontaneous hospitality and I take this as starting point to treat my guests.

Na een academische carrière en jaren in het onderwijs, ben ik sinds 2011 de trotse eigenaar van het koffiehuis “Café Labath” te Gent. 
Mijn passie voor koffie en hospitality vraagt het grootste deel van mijn tijd, daarnaast ga ik graag sporten, lezen en motorijden. Ik heb enkele avontuurlijke reizen gedaan, en de reismicrobe heeft me nog steeds niet losgelaten. Intussen spendeer ik veel tijd in Colombia, om daar “Direct Trade” koffie te zoeken. Door goede banden op te bouwen met lokale boeren, kan ik de lekkerste koffies importeren voor de koffiebar.
De memorabele momenten van spontane gastvrijheid op mijn reizen koester ik nog steeds. Die gastvrijheid heb ik steeds zelf voor ogen bij het ontvangen van mijn gasten.

It has enough medieval frivolity to create a spectacle but retains a gritty industrial edge that keeps things ‘real’.

I’m spending a great deal of my time on my passion for coffee and hospitality. Doing sports, traveling, reading and riding my motorbike are some other things I love. 
At this point I have expanded the business to the point that we follow up on the entire chain from coffee tree to cup. I’m spending a lot of time in Colombia, where I visit local farmers in order to get the best coffee for the coffee bar. 
I used to travel quite adventurously myself. I still cherish these memorable moments of spontaneous hospitality and I take this as starting point to treat my guests.

Na een academische carrière en jaren in het onderwijs, ben ik sinds 2011 de trotse eigenaar van het koffiehuis “Café Labath” te Gent. 
Mijn passie voor koffie en hospitality vraagt het grootste deel van mijn tijd, daarnaast ga ik graag sporten, lezen en motorijden. Ik heb enkele avontuurlijke reizen gedaan, en de reismicrobe heeft me nog steeds niet losgelaten. Intussen spendeer ik veel tijd in Colombia, om daar “Direct Trade” koffie te zoeken. Door goede banden op te bouwen met lokale boeren, kan ik de lekkerste koffies importeren voor de koffiebar.
De memorabele momenten van spontane gastvrijheid op mijn reizen koester ik nog steeds. Die gastvrijheid heb ik steeds zelf voor ogen bij het ontvangen van mijn gasten.

I’m spending a great deal of my time on my passion for coffee and hospitality. Doing sports, traveling, reading and riding my motorbike are some other things I love. 
At this point I have expanded the business to the point that we follow up on the entire chain from coffee tree to cup. I’m spending a lot of time in Colombia, where I visit local farmers in order to get the best coffee for the coffee bar. 
I used to travel quite adventurously myself. I still cherish these memorable moments of spontaneous hospitality and I take this as starting point to treat my guests.

Na een academische carrière en jaren in het onderwijs, ben ik sinds 2011 de trotse eigenaar van het koffiehuis “Café Labath” te Gent. 
Mijn passie voor koffie en hospitality vraagt het grootste deel van mijn tijd, daarnaast ga ik graag sporten, lezen en motorijden. Ik heb enkele avontuurlijke reizen gedaan, en de reismicrobe heeft me nog steeds niet losgelaten. Intussen spendeer ik veel tijd in Colombia, om daar “Direct Trade” koffie te zoeken. Door goede banden op te bouwen met lokale boeren, kan ik de lekkerste koffies importeren voor de koffiebar.
De memorabele momenten van spontane gastvrijheid op mijn reizen koester ik nog steeds. Die gastvrijheid heb ik steeds zelf voor ogen bij het ontvangen van mijn gasten.

I am a painter and teacher living and working in Ghent. 
It is not easy to describe myself, but I will give it a try! 
I can be a little shy or insecure sometimes. But I also like to talk a lot. I love having people around me. Everything is very 'ordened ' in my home, as well as in the painting studio. There is a big love for ""how things look"". 
My interests: everything. 
It sounds weird, I know. 
My favourite thing to do is cooking and inviting people at my home and throwing a dinner. 
As for music preferences, I love jazz and classical music.
I love animals, even though I do not own any. 
I am quite good with languages. At the moment I am studying Italian. I can speak Dutch, English, French and a little Deutsch. 
Reading is something I often do. 
I am writing a book now as well.  
Travelling interests me very much.   
In my studio there are a lot of rather small paintings, but lately they're bigger. The subject consists out of anything in my area, mostly objects, but also people. 
I work as an art teacher, secretary volunteer, art collection guard, study support teacher, French teacher and bed&breakfast host.

As flight attendants  we’ve been travelling all over the world and had to stay in hotels. Hotel rooms are practically all the same and so I find it more enjoyable to stay in houses of local people. In addition you get more insight information wich I value.

They alternate between me and their dad every other week.  

3 years ago, when their father and I got separated, I was looking for a house or an appartment for me and my 2 kids, but appartments turned out to be too expensive. On my search I accidentally bumped into a house boat for sale. Since I had been dreaming about this in earlier years, I decided to jump in the deep water ;-) and bought the Aurelia Feria end of 2017. It is a 'spits', used to be a cargo boat of 40 m long and was build end of the 60's. 

Since January 2020 the boat is back at its permanent own spot on the water after a thorough renovation. And my children as well as me are enjoying our new home to the fullest, even though it is not completely finished and I can not see, feel or smell paint anymore. 
I myself am an independant psychologist doing projects in HR for the moment, but as said in the boat description, I will be using the boatloft also as my working place to guide groups and individuals on their quest to connection, with themselves, with others and with the world around them. 

 And at the same time, I want to also offer it to people all around the world to come and experience life on a boat and discover the fantastic city of Ghent, where I have been living for the last 20 years. Let me know what the space brings you or still needs to serve its purpose.

-The house locates in a calm area but not far from Gent centre. 
- This is a simple but comfortable accommodation 
Home Trietje passes strict rules of the Belgian authorities. So, there is no difference between Home Trietje and a two star hotel in terms of safety, hygiene and comfort. 
-The privacy of my guests are respected (guests don’t have to share the house with anyone). 
- There is no reception desk; no one bothers my guests.  The door is accessible via self check-in with code but I am available  if needed either to solve any issue/problem occurred or my guests just feel a need to meet me in person
